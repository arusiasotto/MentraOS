/**
 * The one place that decides what we send ACS: geometry, rate, and bitrate
 * ceiling. The declared format, the outgoing constraints, and the source target
 * size all read from here so they cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Drift is not cosmetic. ACS runs a rate controller over a fixed bitrate
 * budget, and its only levers are quality and dropped frames. If we advertise
 * 30 fps and send 15, it reserves budget for frames that never arrive; if we
 * advertise a rate we cannot sustain, it does the same. Either way the wire
 * rate collapses while our own counters look healthy.
